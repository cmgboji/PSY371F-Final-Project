**Project Description:** Inflation impacts nearly every aspect of daily life, from the cost of groceries and gas to long-term goals such as home ownership. As prices rise, individuals may experience increased economic stress and dissatisfaction. Although happiness is a subjective experience, it often reflects an individual's sense of security and stability. Understanding how economic factors like inflation relate to national happiness can provide valuable insight into broader patterns of well-being, particularly across countries with varying levels of wealth. Understanding how inflation correlates with happiness and how these patterns differ by region can provide valuable insight into broader social, economic, and political dynamics. This study aims to explore the relationship between inflation rates and reported happiness levels across different nations.
